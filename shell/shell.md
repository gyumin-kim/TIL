# Shell

> A shell is a computer program which **exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs**. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

> It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

> Shell is a UNIX term for **the interactive user interface with an operating system**. The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter.
